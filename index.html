      In the field of mathematics there are many conflicting views about its origins, many of which have given rise to Platonism, the belief that mathematical objects exist independently of human thoughts, 
      and Constructivism, the belief that mathematics is a human invention. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compare these views and identify their compelling information without introducing bias, 
      using accredited sources of information. Firstly, the ideas behind Platonism in mathematics are discussed and factors that have led mathematicians to believe in this philosophical ideology. Next, the 
      theory of Constructivism in mathematics is identified, and the reasonings behind why some mathematicians have adopted this idea. Then, I identify a view where the belief is that both discovery and 
      creativity play roles in the advancement of mathematics. Finally, I outline whether I agree with Platonism or Constructivism, in a conclusion, using all the evidence presented in this paper and my 
      reasoning for my final decision.

      Platonism is the belief that mathematical objects exist independently of human thoughts. This can be supported with Bouveresse J (2005) ‘On the Meaning of the Word ‘Platonism’ in the Expression 
      ‘Mathematical Platonism’. Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society. Volume 105 (New Series), pp. 55-79 “For PLATO, the mathematical world is an independent world, bearing in itself its own laws… the existence 
      of the mathematical beings is independent of human thinking”. Therefore, this identifies that Platonists believe humans have no part in the creation of mathematical concepts and that they already exist for 
      humans to discover. In addition, as this reference states that mathematics has “bearing in itself its own laws”, this is used to show that mathematics is its own enclosed system which further supports the 
      belief that humans don’t invent mathematics, they only uncover what already exists.

      <pre>
      However, some mathematicians believe that discovery and creativity are both important in the future of mathematical advances. This is referenced from <a href="https://www-jstor-org.surrey.idm.oclc.org/stable/27966866?sid=primo">H. Veldkamp A (1990) ‘Created or discovered?’ The Mathematics Teacher Volume 83 (Number 8), p. 599</a>
      Teacher Volume 83 (Number 8), p. 599 “… neither can operate except in interaction with the other… mathematics advances through the interaction of discovery and creativity.” The Author of this journal article states 
      that both, creation and discovery must occur for mathematics to continue to progress. Therefore, combining both Platonism and Constructivism ideology you can interpret this reference as humans invent mathematical 
      objects by extracting elements from the world. In addition, the Author suggests that for either one to occur they must both occur together, which proposes a link between creation and discovery, and how they aid each 
      other in mathematical development rather than appose.
