      In the field of mathematics there are many conflicting views about its origins, many of which have given rise to Platonism, the belief that mathematical objects exist independently of human thoughts, 
      and Constructivism, the belief that mathematics is a human invention. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compare these views and identify their compelling information without introducing bias, 
      using accredited sources of information. Firstly, the ideas behind Platonism in mathematics are discussed and factors that have led mathematicians to believe in this philosophical ideology. Next, the 
      theory of Constructivism in mathematics is identified, and the reasonings behind why some mathematicians have adopted this idea. Then, I identify a view where the belief is that both discovery and 
      creativity play roles in the advancement of mathematics. Finally, I outline whether I agree with Platonism or Constructivism, in a conclusion, using all the evidence presented in this paper and my 
      reasoning for my final decision.

    <ins>Platonism</ins>
      Platonism is the belief that mathematical objects exist without humans having invented them, which is supported with <a href="Bouveresse, J. (2005) ‘On the Meaning of the Word ‘Platonism’ in the Expression ‘Mathematical Platonism’, Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, New Series Volume 105, pp. 55-79">(Bouveresse, 2005)</a> “For PLATO, the mathematical world is an independent world, bearing in 
      itself its own laws… the existence of the mathematical beings is independent of human thinking”. Therefore, this identifies that Platonists believe humans have no part in the creation of mathematical concepts 
      and that they already exist for humans to discover. In addition, as this reference states that mathematics has “bearing in itself its own laws”, this is used to show that mathematics is its own enclosed 
      system which further supports the belief that humans don’t invent mathematics, they only uncover what already exists.

      A reason why Constructivism isn’t possible, which therefore gives evidence for Platonism, is that if we do invent a mathematical concept, it isn’t a basic concept which leads to the understanding of other 
      topics. This is shown in Pitici and Mumford (2013, pp 41-53) “Another argument against the idea that one brings an abstract concept into existence when one invents it is that the concept that we invent are not 
      fundamental enough”. This supports the argument for Platonism because no proper concepts which can be fundamental to mathematical systems are created by humans, therefore the fundamental mathematical 
      principles are discovered which have already existed in the world before being discovered.

    <ins>Constructivism</ins>
      Constructivism is the philosophical belief that humans invent mathematical concepts rather than discovering them in the world, which is supported by (Rowlands and Davies, 2011) “Mathematics is a human activity 
      born out of the ability to group objects, form relations out of doing so and create theoretical objects such as lines, triangles and numbers in the process”. This belief describes the possible human nature 
      of mathematics as it is derived from our “ability to group objects”, conveying how human skills lead to mathematical inventions. The author of this journal article further details how humans already understand 
      mathematics due to our ability to create “theoretical objects” rather than discovering them from the world around us.

      Furthermore, it is argued that mathematical concepts are created as they are used to link individual theories together. This is outlined in (Rowlands and Davies, 2011) “Mathematics was invented because it is 
      a way of relating one object to another. Before maths existed nothing related to anything else… After maths was invented, objects began to be grouped”. In this reference, the author explains how 
      mathematicians are crucial to the advancement of mathematics as they invent mathematical concepts which leads to other objects and concepts being grouped. As a result, this supports the philosophical view 
      of constructivism in mathematics as humans needed to invent mathematics for it to function.

    <ins>A belief in both discovery and creativity:</ins>
      However, some mathematicians believe that discovery and creativity are both important in the future of mathematical advances. This is referenced from (Veldkamp, 1990) “… neither can operate except in interaction 
      with the other… mathematics advances through the interaction of discovery and creativity.” The Author of this journal article states that both, creation and discovery must occur for mathematics to continue to 
      progress. Therefore, combining both Platonism and Constructivism ideology you can interpret this reference as humans invent mathematical objects by extracting elements from the world. In addition, the Author 
      suggests that for either one to occur they must both occur together, which proposes a link between creation and discovery, and how they aid each other in mathematical development rather than appose.

      Another argument for the belief that mathematics is a combination of invention and discovery is that fundamental mathematical concepts already exist, however their definitions are invented by humans. This is 
      indicated by (Rowlands and Davies, 2011) “Mathematics is discovered because the rules that apply are necessary truths. However, the forms to describe mathematics are invented as are the languages and pronunciations 
      which express maths”. As a result, the author is suggesting that mathematics requires humans to understand and invent the explanation of mathematical concepts that have been discovered in the world of mathematics.
